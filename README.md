# VerTechX-SustainabilityChallenge
This repo consists of 6 main folders:

1- Project documentation:

in this folder, you will find three files. The first file is the project proposal which contains a detailed study of the project, including the problems it solves, how the project solves them, the objectives of the project, and the expected outcomes.

the second file contains a detailed financial plan for the prototype of the project including the needed hardware components and the cost for each component 

the final file contains an overview of the targeted crop, soybeans, including the environment the project should provide.

2- Software:

The software of the project consists of 2 main parts: the first part is an AI Strawberry-Classification-CNN model that takes strawberry photos and tells the user whether the strawberry is healthy or sick in order to monitor crop health. and the other part is responsible for controlling the system using one master controller and 3 slave controllers.

3- Hardware:

this file includes pictures of the PCB that we designed for the project.

4- Mechanical Design:

this file includes pictures of the Mechanical design that we designed for the project.

5- Simulink models:

This folder contains 3 models. The first model simulates temperature control in the Vertical farm. The second one simulates an irrigation system using a PI controller. and the last model simulates the power system that feeds the Vertical Farm

6- ThingSpeak:
This folder contains a file that is responsible for the communication between the vertical farm and the thingSpeak platform
